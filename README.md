# HTTPMethodScanner

A very basic extension to help test different HTTP methods. Add to Burp, then go to Proxy History or Site Map, select which items you want to scan and right click "Scan HTTP Methods"

The extension will create "info" items in the scanner results. It will only show server responses of 200 or 301 only. The Extender output for the extension however will show all the results. Feel free to modify as needed.

Also, a simple python script is included that does the same thing.
